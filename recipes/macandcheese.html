    <img src="../images/pulledpork.jpeg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. 
        I like to serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!</p>
    <p>This pulled pork recipe is tender, juicy, and oh-so flavorful — 
      and it’s incredibly easy to make in your slow cooker! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oil</strong>: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker. </li>
      <li><strong>Pork</strong>: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time. </li>
      <li><strong>Sauces</strong>: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple cider vinegar</strong>: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors. </li>
      <li><strong>Broth</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth. </li>
      <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong>: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness. </li>
      <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.</li>
      <li><strong>Onion</strong>: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Buns</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil. </li>
      <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker. </li>
      <li>Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily. </li>
      <li>Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices. </li>
      <li>If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns. </li>
    </ol>
