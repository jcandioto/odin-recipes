    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salting the ribeye steak two days prior to cooking brines the steak, 
      helps tenderize it, and adds rich flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>6 (8 ounce) rib-eye steaks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 Â½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        Sprinkle both sides of steaks with black pepper.</li>
